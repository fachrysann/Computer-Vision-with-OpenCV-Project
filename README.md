# Finger Counting with OpenCV
After implementing finger counting using edge detection and contours, I'll try using deep learning for this project. Afterward, I will compare the two methods.
The dataset: [ðŸ”— View the Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koryakinp/fingers)<br>
The dataset contains 21,600 images of left and right hands, with finger counts from 0 to 5. All images are 128x128 pixels.

## Results with Basic CNN

As we can see, it's still not perfect, even though the model achieved an accuracy of over 96% and a loss of less than 1% on test images. But it's still better than traditional method that can't predict in dim lights, but with Deep Learning it's more achieveable.
## ProblemsðŸ¤”
ðŸŸ¥ The model may make incorrect predictions if the angle of the captured fingers differs from the dataset.<br>
ðŸŸ¥ The model will make incorrect predictions if the background is not blank.<br>
# How to tackle the problems:
ðŸ”² Process the dataset to make it more like binary threshold images and train the model using that dataset.<br>
ðŸ”² Try different model architectures or use a pretrained model with the ImageNet dataset, hoping that it can better differentiate between fingers and backgrounds.<br>
ðŸ”² Add more images to the dataset by recording my own fingers and labeling them.<br>
ðŸ”² Try different data augmentation techniques and find the best way to augment the dataset.<br>
